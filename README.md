# Password Generator

## Description

While doing this assignment, I was challenged more than ever. There was a moment I felt incapable. I had to shake off the negativity and believe in myself and my capabilities. Then I had to put them into action. I started working harder and harder until I finally was able to complete it. I had created a final product that I was happy with. Here I created a password generator for a company so that their employers had a way to secure data for their employees.

## Usage

To use this app I created, all you have to do is click on the red button that says "Generate Password". It will prompt the folllowing questions: How many characters you want your password to include uppercase, lowercase, special character or numbers in your password. After you finish answering these questions the app will generate your secured password.
